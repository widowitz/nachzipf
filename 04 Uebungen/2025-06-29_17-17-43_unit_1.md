**My Summer Holidays**

During my summer holidays, I visited my grandparents. They live in a lovely village. Every morning, I helped my grandma in the garden. She grows the most beautiful flowers. In the afternoon, my grandpa and I went fishing by the lake. He always tells the funniest stories about when he was young. In the evenings, we had dinner together and talked about our day. I really enjoyed my time there because it's always peaceful and relaxing.
