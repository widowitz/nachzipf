### Abschreibtext: Unit 1 â€“ First day back at school

Bitte schreibe den folgenden Text ab. Achte auf korrekte Grammatik und Rechtschreibung:

One sunny morning, Luna stood at her bedroom window, gazing at the school yard. She was excited to start her first day back at school after the long summer holidays. During the break, Luna traveled to the beach with her family and spent time learning about milk snakes and coral snakes. She was always fascinated by nature and couldn't wait to share her experiences with her classmates.

Luna loved her school subjects, especially science and art. She was looking forward to meeting her new teachers and seeing her friends again. As she packed her bag, she remembered to bring her favorite book about snakes, hoping to show it during show-and-tell. Luna's mother called out, reminding her not to forget her lunch box.

When Luna arrived at school, she was greeted by the familiar sounds of laughter and chatter. Her friend Sarah ran up to her, asking about her summer adventures. Luna couldn't wait to tell her all about the colorful coral snakes she saw and the fun times at the beach.

This year, Luna promised herself to study hard and join the school's environmental club. She believed that even small actions could make a big difference in protecting nature. As the school bell rang, Luna felt ready and determined to make the most of her new school year.
