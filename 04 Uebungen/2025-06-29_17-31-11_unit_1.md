It was the first day back at school after the summer holidays. Marlene was excited to see her friends again. She wore her new uniform and packed her bag with all the things she needed. In the morning, she ate breakfast quickly so she wouldn't be late. At school, her teacher asked everyone to talk about their holidays. Marlene told the class about her trip to the mountains. She said it was fun because she learned to hike. Her friends shared their stories too. After that, they talked about their favorite school subjects. Marlene likes English the most because she enjoys reading. The day ended with a call to action from Luna, encouraging everyone to join the school club.
