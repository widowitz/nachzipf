### Text zum Abschreiben ‚úçÔ∏è

Last summer, I went to a wonderful place. It was a small village near the mountains. Every day, I got up early and went for a walk. The mornings were fresh and the air was clean. I met many friendly people who lived there. They told me about their daily routines. In the afternoon, I usually visited a small caf√© to enjoy a cup of tea. In the evenings, the sky was full of stars, and I loved to watch them. It was a peaceful time, and I felt very happy there. I hope to go back next summer.
